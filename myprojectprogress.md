One project would be to create an emulator with WiFi across systems \(i.e. from emulator on pc 1 to emulator on pc 2\).<br/>
However, I want to look around at other projects before I commit to this idea. Unless I see a bunch of people joining<br/>
my project quickly, I would likely just use a centralized workflow, as that is simpler with a small group. However,<br/>
if I see an influx of people, then I would most likely switch to an integrator workflow \(blessed repo\), since that would<br/>
allow for better synchronization. The Gitflow workflow might be worth a look, but I don't think I'll commit to that.
